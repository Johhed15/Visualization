# This repository contains some of the work completed by me and anther student during a visualization course in my master's program.

The code is written in R with mostly using packages like ggplot2, plotly, dplyr, tidyr and shiny.
The work is done in Rmarkdown and html's have been generated, but they could be too large to view here on github. 


The labs contain various types of graphs and problems, increasing in complexity!

lab 1: Density plots in ggplot and plotly
lab 2: Scatterplots created with ggplot and non-metric MDS on baseball data
lab 3: Maps created with Mapbox and plotly(plot_geo)
lab 4: Heatmaps and  parallel coordinatet created with plotly and trellis plot with ggplot
lab 5: Several interactive graphs created with visNetwork and plotly
lab 6: Word clouds created with wordcloud package and different interactive plots with filter and brushing etc created with plotly.

#### If you have any questions regarding the work, please contact me
