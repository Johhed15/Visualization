# This repository contains some of the work completed by me and anther student during a visualization course in my master's program.

The code is written in R with mostly using packages like ggplot2, plotly, dplyr, tidyr and shiny.
The work is done in Rmarkdown and html's have been generated, but they could be too large to view here on github. 


*The labs contain various types of graphs and problems, increasing in complexity!*

lab 1: Density plots in ggplot and plotly and a shiny app! <br><br>
lab 2: Scatterplots created with ggplot and non-metric MDS on baseball data <br><br>
lab 3: Maps created with Mapbox and plotly(plot_geo) <br><br>
lab 4: Heatmaps and  parallel coordinatet created with plotly and trellis plot with ggplot <br><br>
lab 5: Several interactive graphs created with visNetwork and plotly <br><br>
lab 6: Word clouds created with wordcloud package and different interactive plots with filter and brushing etc created with plotly. <br>
